## Database:

- I choose **SQLite** as the database, which is lightweight relational database and it is a popular choice for 
small-scale applications and offers simplicity and ease of use.
- I choose SQLAlchemy to interact with the SQLite database and provide the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) service. 
**SQLAlchemy** is a powerful SQL toolkit and ORM library that supports various database systems, including SQLite. 
- It provides a convenient and intuitive way to interact with the database using Python code.
By utilizing SQLite as the database and SQLAlchemy as the SQL toolkit and ORM, you can effectively manage and manipulate your data within your application.
